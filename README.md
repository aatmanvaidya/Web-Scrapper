# Web-Scrapper

This is a simple Web Scrapper using python. 

You can use it to extract links, paragraphs and anchor tags from a website.     

I have used the [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/home/) websiste as an example. 

For the image scrapper the website I have used is [Ahmedabad University's](https://ahduni.edu.in/) Website.
